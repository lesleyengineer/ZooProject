# ZooProject

Why are we doing this?
To create an application using the skills I have learned so far.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I was comfortable with the front end part of the task but was quite worried about the back end.

What went well?

What didn't go as planned?

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
