# ZooProject

Why are we doing this?
To create an application using the skills I have learned so far.  Also, by putting things into practice this will hopefully let us build on what we know and see where our areas of development are.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I was comfortable with the front end part of the task but was quite worried about the back end.  Having spent 2 days on it, I am aware that my back end knowledge needs a bit of work.  I am very happy to play about on VS code and can always seem to find the answer I need but this is not the case with the back end work.

What went well?
I couldn't link any of the work I did on SQL to my website which was disappointing.

What didn't go as planned?
My js file was unable to link to my project so I wasn't able to show the table I had made.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Now that I know the areas that I struggle with I will work my time better in furture.
